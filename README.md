# Inbox Guardian
## Overview
Inbox Guardian is an AI-powered email threat scanner made in a small package for your browser. By installing it as an extension, you can get real-time analysis on your currently open email on popular email sites such as Gmail and Outlook. Inbox Guardian is powered by Tensorflow and runs entirely on your machine to ensure privacy. No information ever leaves your computer! Our tool will let users, from everyday browsers to tech specialists, have a second opinion on security when viewing their inbox.

## Purpose
When designing this tool, we sought to fill a need for the everyday internet user by adding a needed layer of security to their inbox. My mom often asks me if an email she received is real or a scam, and now we have something that can help her make these decisions herself. Even in businesses, users still fall for phishing attacks that manage to bypass automated filters. They assume that since it wasnâ€™t blocked, it must be safe. By serving as a second pair of eyes, rather than a filter that simply lets emails in or blocks them, we promote caution and awareness in the context of email security. The best part is that the whole extension can be used with the single click of a button, and on top of our straightforward and 
simplistic GUI, you get an easy-to-digest analysis within milliseconds.
